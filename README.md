# Saddle Points

Detect saddle points in a matrix.

So say you have a matrix like so:

```text
    0  1  2
  |---------
0 | 9  8  7
1 | 5  3  2     <--- saddle point at (1,0)
2 | 6  6  7
```

It has a saddle point at (1, 0).

It's called a "saddle point" because it is greater than or equal to
every element in its row and less than or equal to every element in
its column.

A matrix may have zero or more saddle points.

Your code should be able to provide the (possibly empty) list of all the
saddle points for any given matrix.

Note that you may find other definitions of matrix saddle points online,
but the tests for this exercise follow the above unambiguous definition.

## Writing the Code

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ cargo test
```

All but the first test have been ignored. After you get the first test to
pass, open the tests source file which is located in the `tests` directory
and remove the `#[ignore]` flag from the next test and get the tests to pass
again. Each separate test is a function with `#[test]` flag above it.
Continue, until you pass every test.

If you wish to run all tests without editing the tests source file, use:

```bash
$ cargo test -- --ignored
```

To run a specific test, for example `some_test`, you can use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test
```

If the specific test is ignored use:

```bash
$ cargo test some_test -- --ignored
```
